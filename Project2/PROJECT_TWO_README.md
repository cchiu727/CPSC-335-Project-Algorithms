#Introduction 
This project consists of three parts: finding the Fibonacci series with the use of exhaustive pattern and golden ratio and finding the largest sum subarray. For exahustive pattern, we use a given formula to print out the 15th term of the sequence. For the golden ratio, we use 3 given formulas to print out the first 20 terms of the sequence. For the largest subarray, we use sample outputs to find the numbers to create subarrays for numbers that create the largest sums

#Important Note 
All numbers used in the Fibonacci questions must be postive. The subarray question may have negative questions.

#Requirements 
The only thing you need is the cpp files themselves. Nothing extra is needed other than basic Linux commands.

#Installation 
 Three .exe files are included in the .zip file. However, if any errors occur, please refer to the following instructions. Install this code by simply downloading it and running it normally in Tuffix. The commands for running are g++ FILENAME.cpp -o FILENAME and ./FILENAME>
(Note: type your desired file name in place of FILENAME)

#Configuration 
You are allowed to determine how many items appear in the list. You can also change the array in subarray problem to try out different outputs.
For fibRecursive.cpp, it asks the user to input a positive integer n. It will output the nth term in the Fibonacci Sequence.
For fibRatio.cpp, it asks the user to input a positive integer p, and positive integer n. p should be less than n. It will output the Fibnoacci sequence starting at the pth term up until the nth term.
For sumArray.cpp, the user can put in an array of several values and in any order. In doing so, the program will create a subarray of the highest sums from the orignal array.
