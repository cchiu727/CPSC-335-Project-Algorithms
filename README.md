#Introduction
This project is to solve a problem using algorithms. This specific project gives us an array of circles that alternate from light, dark, light, dark, etc.
Using algorithms, we need to organize the circles so that all the dark circles are on the right side with the light circles on the left. The input of the
algorithm should be a positive integer 𝑛 and a list of 2𝑛 disks of alternating colors light-dark, starting with light and the output should be a list of 2𝑛 
disks, the first 𝑛 disks are dark, the next 𝑛 disks are light, and an integer 𝑚 representing the number of swaps to move the light ones after the dark ones.

#Important Note
Since C++ cannot make actual shapes in code, we used numbers to represent the light and dark circles. 0 represents the dark circles and 1 represents the light circles

#Requirements
