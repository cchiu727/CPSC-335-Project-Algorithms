#Introduction
This project involves two different problems. In the first problem we must solve an array sorting problem by using patterns. Specifically, we need to find target words inside of array A of jumbled letters with array B that contains the target words. After that we must output the words in order and the positions they first appear in. The second problem involves using merge sort to sort 4 arrays of varying sizes and scores. The output will take all the arrays of scores and put them all in order.

#Important Note
The arrays are already coded in. If the arrays need to be changed you must go into the actual code and manually change the arrays.

#Requirements
The only thing you need is the cpp files themselves. Nothing extra is needed other than basic Linux commands.

#Installation
Install this code by simply downloading it and running it normally in Tuffix

#Configuration
You can create your own set of 4 arrays in part 2 of the project by going inside the code itself
